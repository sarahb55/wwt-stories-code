How can educators teach Astronomy concepts for deep understanding?  To answer this question, we developed and field-tested a WWT-based lab about the Moon's phases.  This is a topic required in the middle school science curriculum of most states and is commonly cited by teachers as being an area few students truly understand.

Our WWT Moon Lab combines physical models with interactive WWT tours to help students understand the relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon, why the Moon appears to have phases when viewed from Earth, and why we sometimes experience eclipses.
