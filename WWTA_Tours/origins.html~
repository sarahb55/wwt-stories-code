<div id="slidesmall" style="position:absolute;left:25px;top:370px">
In spring 2010, 6th grade science teacher Michelle Bartley integrated WWT tour-making into a six-week Astronomy unit with her students.  Students proposed their own topics to research and worked in small groups to create multi-media presentations about what they learned, using WWT.  This was quite a change from the basic Powerpoint presentations created in years past!
