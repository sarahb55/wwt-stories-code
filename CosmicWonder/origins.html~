The Adler Planetarium needed to produce their feature planetarium show for 2013. The theme: how humans have always wondered about what they have seen in the night sky, and how that wonder has encouraged them to learn more about the Universe. The Adler also wanted to feature their historic collections and the Zooniverse citizen science projects in the production.
<p>
Only Â¼ the normal production time was available. Using WWT enabled Adler to rapidly produce a full skyshow featuring real imagery rather than computer models, and to do so in a small fraction of the time and cost of a more typical fulldome skyshow production.
