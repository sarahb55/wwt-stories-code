Cosmic Wonder opened in May 2013 to rave reviews.
<p>
<em>“What's new about the show is that it's almost all done with Microsoft's WorldWide Telescope. Yes, the images the software giant has stored on remote servers look amazing when projected onto the Grainger dome. Yes, they tell a compelling story of discovery when organized for "Cosmic Wonder" (and backed by local musician Benn Jordan's subtly propulsive original soundtrack).
<p>
But, almost better than that, you can download the WorldWide Telescope application (worldwidetelescope.org) and explore the images at your own pace, in service to your own sense of wonder.”</em>
<p>
-Steve Johnson, Chicago Tribune May 14, 2013

The show is still running today at the Adler, to date nearly a quarter of a million people have seen the show.
