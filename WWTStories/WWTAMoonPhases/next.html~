The WWT Moon Phases Lab is available on the <a href="http://wwtambassadors.org/book/worldwide-telescope-moon-phases-visualization-lab-3"> WWT Ambassadors website</a>, and it is published at <a href="http://BetterLesson.com">BetterLesson.com</a>, a teacher network for sharing lesson plans, where the WWT Moon Phases Visualization Lab is the most popular result on Moon phases.  Our group is in the process of negotiating an agreement with PBS Learning Media to include our Moon phases lesson plan in their database, which counts 40% of US K-12 educators among its users.

WWT Ambassadors recently submitted a proposal to NSF Discovery Research K-12 (DRK12) to further refine the Moon Phases and to develop additional Astronomy modules aligned with Next Generation Science Standards. Look for WWT in schools near you!
