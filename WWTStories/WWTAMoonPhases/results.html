The project included five pilot teachers and 650 students, and our results show that meaningful scientific exploration can be done in a cost-effective way in K12 schools around existing curricular topics. Every cohort of students in the study showed strong learning gains.  The activities improved learning and were engaging to a variety of student demographics, including students in diverse, urban and suburban school districts.  Activities like the WWT Moon Phases Lab, if widely adopted, could make a meaningful difference in student understanding of and interest in science, engineering, and technology.
