I supervised this myself with the help of Dave Morton who manages our departmentâ€™s computer labs. Doug Roberts has advised all along and we also had the good fortune to have Laura Trouille visit the class. She gave a talk about her research, but she also paid attention to what we were doing here.

Both Doug and Laura are at Northwestern University.
