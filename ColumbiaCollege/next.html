I would like to try the WWT again, but am not slated to teach astronomy at the moment. It might be interesting to try the experiment in some other way at the college, maybe as a joint project with an audio production class. Unfortunately, I don’t have the connections in that department. This use, however, of big data in layer based tools is an important skill that I want to expose all my students too.

I think that the idea of having the students make up their own narratives and not simply try to make scientific documentaries is a really important way to use the WorldWide Telescope. I had a brief conversation with Tim Slater about this use of story telling and he thinks it’s a promising way to teach astronomy because people get engaged and learn so well through stories. I would certainly be open to extending the experiment to focus on the narrative end and try to solve the team work challenges. But, I will wait until I teach an astronomy course again and or some collaborators. (In astrobiology I rely upon JMARS and do actual research. I will be teaching two sections in that come spring 2015.)
