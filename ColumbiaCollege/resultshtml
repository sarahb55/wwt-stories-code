The results were both challenging and promising. The major challenge was in organizing, supervising and then grading the work of student teams. They were hard put to coordinate their work together since most are commuting students whose majors are audio, game, musical theater and even fasion design. Some teams did better than others, but this type of production effort, where the grade was a minor part of the course was maybe not the best way to proceed. I would re-think that in the future. The other challenge was that the students who had animation and 3D modeling skills simply didn’t have the time within the course structure to show off their higher level animation abilities.

The major benefit, and surprise, however, was how well their scripts turned out. I gave them free reign to write a narrative script as long as they didn’t violate the necessary science. So, each team came up with a fictional, narrative story. The stories were quite surprising and fresh. All were voice acted well and recorded professionally in Columbia’s sound studios. Some had musical accompaniments too. The titles and brief descriptions were:

</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Supernova Sighted</b> — This featured two cat astronauts who are off to visit a supernova explosion. One of the students drew animation key frames of her characters. The story was also clever because of a sub plot involving a romantic relationship between the two characters.</li>

<li>	<b>All My Stars are Dead</b> — This was about stellar death in the galaxy. The narrator is a fictional star who is depressed about all his friends now being dead. It featured visits to planetary nebulae an supernova remnants.</li>

<li>	<b>Black Hole Support Group</b> — This one was short on visuals, but the acting and story were hilarious. Black holes were personified. It was a support group of supergiant, stellar size and even a mini black hole. They riffed on the bad rap they’d been given as black holes. They sang a song about how they didn’t suck, etc. It was quite humorous and yet the science was just fine.</li>

<li>	<b>Star Hustler</b> — This one was a star salesman who was much like a used car salesman. He tries to convince a young woman to buy a star. It too featured a number of voices and was rather funny and yet the science was good.</li>
</ul>

</p>

The big take away here was that the student narratives and their productions were fresh and lively yet didn’t compromise the science. The “production” of its use in the course was very challenging, however, because of the teamwork necessary and getting access to audio production facilities. I’m not sure I could routinely get the latter and there were a host of problems managing the teams.

This has not been published, although I did include a mention of it during a summer conference at Columbia sponsored by INTETAIN. The attendees there were quite interested in the WWT, but asked me when I was going to “gameify” what I was doing. I didn’t have an answer because I wouldn’t know how to do that. I always have game design students, however. If there was a way to incorporate WWT into a game, I would be interested.
