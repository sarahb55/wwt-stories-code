WorldWide Telescope was used in an astronomy course (Stars and Galaxies, Spring 2014) at Columbia College Chicago to engage undergraduates in that task of producing tours. Columbia is an arts and media college, so the focus was primarily on the production issues and learning how to use the WWT to explore data sets.

WWT was chosen because it has tour production capabilities in addition to giving the students access to layer-based astronomical data.
