The project was conducted as an experiment in the spring term of 2014. (I used JMARS to explore Mars data in a separate course on astrobiology.) For the astronomy course, however, the WWT seemed to be an ideal tool. We used it as a major part of the computer “lab” portion of the astronomy course. The students were divided into four production teams with typical production roles, including: production manager, writer, audio producer, art director, voice actor and technical director. Since I have extensive experience in the production of astronomy media this seemed to be an interesting way to proceed.

We didn’t require funding for this. In the future, however, funding might be helpful if, especially if this approach were to be developed into a way to teach narrative production for other WWT users. I would also need the time as well. Right now, that would be difficult unless the department saw some grant money.
